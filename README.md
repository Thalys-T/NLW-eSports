# NLW eSports

A platform to connect players who are looking for a "duo" to play together, the player create a "ad" categorized by the game showing some info about the player including discord user 
and the game to find a duo then when someone find the ad and choose to "conect" your discord is shown to the person;

Initially the idea was to use twitch's api to bring the games, but because of the problem involving token requisition to consume the api i manualy registered
some games to test the project.
